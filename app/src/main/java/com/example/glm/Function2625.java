// Note: cipherIn is assumed to be a pre-initialized CipherInputStream variable and nextByte is an instance variable of type int. This implementation reads one byte from the cipherIn stream and stores it in nextByte before returning it. The method throws an IOException if there is an error reading from the stream.
